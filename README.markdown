This project is an attempt to recreate the old ZX Spectrum/Commodore 64 game **The Lords of Midnight** using Python and Pygame, mainly as a learning exercise.

Built with reference to [The Tower of the Moon](http://www.icemark.com/tower/ "The Tower of the Moon"), the homepage of another PC conversion of this game.

[The Lords of Midnight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lords_of_Midnight) was produced in 1984 by [Mike Singleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Singleton). No infringement of his (or anyone else's) copyright is implied.
